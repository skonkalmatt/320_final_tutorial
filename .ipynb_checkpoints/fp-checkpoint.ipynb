Since 1993, The UFC has hosted over 500 events, each of which has up to 20 fights. The fights are made and announced by matchemakers and the fighters who are all members of the UFC roster. In the roster there are 8 weight classes for men and 4 weight classes for women, each weight class consisting of approximately 50 fighters. Fighters signed to the UFC typically have made a name for themselves in other combat sports or are elite prospects from smaller or regional MMA promotions, so the UFC has been able to boast the best of the best during its existance.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a given fight night, the fights are made of about 5 fights on the undercard and 5 fights on the main card. The undercard typically consists of new signees and low ranked fights while the main card will include 3-4 mid-ranked fighters with 1-2 high profile bouts, also known as the main event. There is no restriction on which weight class must have a fight on card. Each of the fights consist of three 5 minute rounds (execpt the main event, which has five rounds) where the fight will continue until time runs out and the fight is determined by a decsion by judges or the ref determines that one fighter has ceased to inteligently defend themselves. The ref's decsion can come from several different situations incuding a submission, knockout, or technical knockout.\n",
