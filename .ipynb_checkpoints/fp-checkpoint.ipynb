    "\n",
    "On a given fight night, the fights are made of about 5 fights on the undercard and 5 fights on the main card. The undercard typically consists of new signees and low ranked fights while the main card will include 3-4 mid-ranked fighters with 1-2 high profile bouts, also known as the main event. There is no restriction on which weight class must have a fight on card. Each of the fights consist of three 5 minute rounds (execpt the main event, which has five rounds) where the fight will continue until time runs out and the fight is determined by a decsion by judges or the ref determines that one fighter has ceased to inteligently defend themselves. The ref's decsion can come from several different situations incuding a submission, knockout, or technical knockout.\n",
